--- 1. Infos for maintainers:

If you want to maintain a packet for your favorit OS please let me know!
I would love to be in contact with the maintainers to send them infos about
updates and maybe get feadback or things like init scripts or the like
(see 2. Infos for developer).

If it would make your work simpler I can put things in trunk
(info files for pkg build tools or the like). Just ask.

Also if you need any help you may contact me.

Here is my recommendation on how to split the RoarAudio in pkgs:

libroar               includs libroar and libroardsp
roaraudio-common      include roard and roarclients
                      (at least the ones with no specal deps)
roaraudio-tools       includes all other tools not in roaraudio-common
                      because of specal deps (if any)
roaraudio-compat      includes libroaresd, libroararts, libroarpulse
                      and libroaryiff. It would be nice to ask the user
                      if he wants symlinks from libesd, libarts*, libpulse*.
roaraudio-dev         includes include/
someplayer-roar       pkgs from plugins/

manpages should be included in the corresponding packet.

--- 2. Infos for developer

At the moment all the libs are under GPLv3.
As libesd, libarts*, libpulse* and maybe other are under
LGPL the corresponding roar replacements should be under LGPL as well.
Because they link libroar independent of what licenses they are under
they are downgraded to GPL. This may change in future.

Because of that I *require* that *everything* that is contributed by
someone I get under LGPL so I can upgrade code to LGPL if needed
in future without asking. Code I get under a diffrent licens
will *NOT* get into trunk nor will be hosted by me.

Also add full contact infos when sending code to me, this includes:
1) Full name
2) nickname
3) E-Mail
4) OpenPGP key

Then sending code please sign it with OpenPGP.
