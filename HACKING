At the moment all the libs are under GPLv3.
As libesd, libarts*, libpulse* and maybe other are under
LGPL the corresponding roar replacements should be under LGPL as well.
Because they link libroar independent of what licenses they are under
they are downgraded to GPL. This may change in future.

Because of that I *require* that *everything* that is contributed by
someone I get under LGPL so I can upgrade code to LGPL if needed
in future without asking. Code I get under a diffrent licens
will *NOT* get into trunk nor will be hosted by me.

Also add full contact infos when sending code to me, this includes:
1) Full name
2) nickname
3) E-Mail
4) OpenPGP key

Then sending code please sign it with OpenPGP.
