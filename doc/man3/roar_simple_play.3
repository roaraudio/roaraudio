.SH SYNOPSIS

#include <roaraudio.h>

int roar_simple_play(int rate, int channels, int bits, int codec, char * server, char * name);

int roar_simple_monitor(int rate, int channels, int bits, int codec, char * server, char * name);

int roar_simple_record(int rate, int channels, int bits, int codec, char * server, char * name);

int roar_simple_filter(int rate, int channels, int bits, int codec, char * server, char * name);

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Open a connection to the \fBroard\fR(1) and creates a new stream for playback, monetoring, recording or filtering.

.SH "PARAMETERS"
.TP
\fBrate\fR
The sample rate of the stream.

.TP
\fBchannels\fR
The nummber of channels in the stream.

.TP
\fBbits\fR
The number of bits per sample of the stream.
Commen values are 8 and 16.

.TP
\fBcodec\fR
The Codec of the data you stream to the server.
This has nothing to do with codec of the file you are playing back or encoding.
Default (\fBROAR_CODEC_DEFAULT\fR) is \fBROAR_CODEC_PCM_S_BE\fR for signed PCM in big endian.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
Examples of these calls are the tools \fBroarcat\fR(1), \fBroarmon\fR(1), \fBroarrec\fR(1) and \fBroarfilt\fR(1).
Just look at there code. They aren't that complex.
