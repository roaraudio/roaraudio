Chapter: Description
RoarAudio defines a standard format for transmission of floating point
numbers over the wire. This format is optimized for easy processing
without a floating point unit.

All control information needing a floating point number be transmitted
in the RoarAudio protocol SHOULD use this format.

Chapter: Notion of formats in this document.
All formats in this document use big-endian notation.
This means that the left most digit is the most significant digit.

Hex numbers are prefixed with '0x'. The letter 'X' in hex numbers
is used as wildcard.

Chapter: Float format
The value of a RoarAudio float consists of two parts.
The first part is called scale. The second part is called mul.

The Value A of a floating point number is calculated using the
following formula.
      mul
A = -------
     scale

The scale is sometimes also called div.

Section: General Format

Both Parts, the scale and mul are in big endian (most significant
byte first). The scale is transmitted first.

  first --------> last     Transmission order

 SS = most significant byte of scale,
 ss = least significant byte of scale,
 MM = most significant byte of mul,
 mm = least significant byte of mul.

Section: Signed format

The much more uncommon format for a signed floating point is similar
to the unsigned format expect that the mul is a signed integer in
two's-complement format.

Section: Multifloat

A Multifloat is a set of floating point numbers encoded together.
As floating point numbers which have a direct relation often
have a similar scale the scale is only transmitted once.

A example for such a relation are the volumes for a multichannel audio
stream. In most cases all channels have the same volume.

The floating point numbers A0, A1, ..., An are packed using a single scale.
The value is defined as the following formulas show.

      mul0          mul1               muln
A0 = -------, A1 = -------, ..., An = -------
      scale         scale              scale

The transmission order is scale first followed by the muls in order.

 SS = scale,
 AA = mul0,
 BB = mul1,
 CC = mul2,
 DD = mul3.

Section: Float sizes

The following sizes are defined for normal floats.
Multifloats will have the mul part multiple times and
are bigger because of this.

128	Yes	64		64		-2^63	2^63-1	1/(2^64-1)

Section: Special values
This document defines five different special numbers.

The first special number is zero. Every number with mul set to zero
must be interpreted as zero.

All other specials are constructed by setting the scale to zero.
There are four special values with scale set to zero.

The first is Positive infinity defined by setting mul to one.
Negative infinity is defined by setting mul to the biggest possible
number (all bits set).

Positive NaN is defined as all but the most significant bits set in mul.
Negative NaN in contrast is defined by setting only the most significant bit
in mul.

All other values of mul with a scale of zero SHOULD NOT be used and MUST NOT
if not defined by an additional standard and after confirming that all recipients
of a transmission understand this standard.

Table: 1: Special values for ra-float-u32
Mul	Scale	Description
0x0000	0xXXXX	Zero
0x0001	0x0000	Positive infinity
0xFFFF	0x0000	Negative infinity
0x7FFF	0x0000	Positive NaN
0x8000	0x0000	Negative NaN
