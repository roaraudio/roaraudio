--- What is RoarAudio?:

RoarAudio is a cross-platform sound system for both, home and professional use.
It can be used to mix audio for output on a single-stream soundcard or to play
audio over the network.

--- Build:

-- Build requirements:

A POSIX system.

You should install libesd and libao and maybe some codecs.

(will give strange error messages on non DECnet systems)
