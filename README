                 RoarAudio
             As loud as a Lion
           ---------------------

--- What is RoarAudio?:

RoarAudio is a cross-platform sound system for both, home and professional use.
It can be used to mix audio for output on a single-stream soundcard or to play
audio over the network.

For more Information see our website at:
http://roaraudio.keep-cool.org/

--- Build:

-- Build requirements:

A POSIX system or win32.

You should install libesd and libao and maybe some codecs.
For Debian you may use this command:
 $ apt-get install build-essential libdnet-dev libesd0-dev libao-dev libvorbis-dev libspeex-dev libshout3-dev liboggz1-dev libslp-dev libx11-dev

Note that in case you want to use any emulation you need to install the corresponding
sound system on the build system as we are using headers and other files from those
sound systems to be most compatible. You can safely uninstall them after building
RoarAudio has been completed.

The following binarys are suggested to be installed, too:
 gnupg, openssh-client, socat, wget

Also you maybe want to install µRoar and µRoarD (on debian libmuroar* and muroard).

-- How to build:

 $ ./configure
 $ make

In order to build win32 binarys on UNIX or GNU/Linux:
 $ CC=...mingw32...gcc ./configure --target-win32
 $ make

In order to build win32 binarys on Win32 with MinGW/MSYS:
 $ bash configure
 $ make

--- Plugins:

Plugins should be build automaticly since 0.2rc2.

--- Writing software for RoarAudio:

See manpages: libroar(7) and roartut(7).
You also should read the example code in roarclients/*.c

--- Writing patches for this packet:
