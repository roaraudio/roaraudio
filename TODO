Things we need to do:
 * add _working_ resampling code
 * add support for sync streams
 * add install target to Makefile

Things we should do:
 * add a lot other things
 * add support for config file
 * add a sample rc file
 * add RAUM support

Things it whould be nice to have:
 * add code to handle streams with more than ROAR_MAX_CHANNELS channels
 * add better support for ReplayGain.
 * Consider if we should take conf_* from GIFT.
