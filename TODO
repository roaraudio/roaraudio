Thinks we need to do:
 * add _working_ resampling code
 * add support for sync streams
 * fix byte-order bug in *_set_vol()
 * find out where the memory leaks are

Things we should do:
 * add a lot other things
 * Consider if we should take conf_* from GIFT.
 * add support for config file

Things it whould be nice to have:
 * add code to handle streams with more than ROAR_MAX_CHANNELS channels
 * add support for ReplayGain.
