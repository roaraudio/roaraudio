Things we need to do:
 * add _working_ resampling code
 * add support for sync streams

Things we should do:
 * use vio for output stream, rewrite drivers
 * add a lot other things
 * add support for config file
 * add a sample rc file
 * add RAUM support
 * add sndio support
 * write a libroarsndio
 * replace OpenBSD's aucat

Things it would be nice to have:
 * add code to handle streams with more than ROAR_MAX_CHANNELS channels
 * add better support for ReplayGain.
 * Consider if we should take conf_* from GIFT.
