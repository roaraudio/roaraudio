Things we need to do:
 * (0.3) add _working_ resampling code
 * (1.0) add support for sync streams

Things we should do:
 * (*.*) add a lot other things
 * (1.1) add RAUM support
 * (1.0) replace OpenBSD's aucat
 * (0.3) add support to to roard to auto select a sync stream

Things it would be nice to have:
 * (1.1) add code to handle streams with more than ROAR_MAX_CHANNELS channels
 * (1.0) add better support for ReplayGain.
